Project Overview

This project demonstrates the capabilities of WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) to establish peer-to-peer communication between users via video, audio, and data channels. It integrates real-time signaling using Socket.IO and a custom Express backend hosted on Railway, while the frontend is deployed on Firebase Hosting.

 Features
 
🔗 Room Creation/Joining: Join a room via a unique ID.

🎥 Video & Audio Chat: Connect with peers via live video and audio.

📤 Screen Sharing: Share your screen with others in the room.

💬 Real-time Chat: Send and receive text messages instantly.

😀 Emoji Picker: Add fun and expressiveness to your messages.

🎙️ Media Controls: Toggle microphone, camera, and screen sharing.

📹 Recording: Record your video stream locally (in-browser).

Challenges & Learnings

WebRTC Signaling: Implemented custom signaling logic using Socket.IO.

Peer Connections: Managed connection lifecycle and ICE candidate exchange.

Media Permissions: Handled browser permissions and fallback cases.

Screen Sharing Compatibility: Dealt with varying browser APIs.

Recording with MediaRecorder API: Learned to buffer and save media streams.
